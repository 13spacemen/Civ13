To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Lebensruam. The gameplay is extremely  subtle, and without a solid grasp of your keyboard most of the mechanics will go over a typical player’s head. There’s also Hitlers correct outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from the Jews  for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these deaths, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Lebensruam truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Mods existential catchphrase “Fucking Normies,” which itself is a cryptic reference to CS;GO. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated russians scratching their heads in confusion as Adolf`s genius wit unfolds itself on their battlefield. What fools.. how I pity them. :joy:

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Hitler tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel jew :sunglasses:
